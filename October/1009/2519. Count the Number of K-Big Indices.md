# 2519. Count the Number of K-Big Indices

## Solution

Traverse the array twice, left -> right, right -> left.

* Use max heap to save the first K-th smallest value on the left / right side.
* For each value, if there're K value in heap and the current value is bigger than the max in the heap, it fulfill the condition.
* If a indice fulfill both side, then it is a K-big indice.

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop
class Solution:
    def kBigIndices(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        maxheap = []
        Kbig_left = [0] * len(nums)
        # Find all indices that fulfill the 1st condition
        # There're at least k vals smaller than the current val on the left
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if len(maxheap) == k and -maxheap[0] < nums[i]:
                Kbig_left[i] = 1
            heappush(maxheap, -nums[i])
            if len(maxheap) > k:
                heappop(maxheap)

        # Find all indices that fulfill the 2nd condition
        # There're at least k vals smaller than the current val on the right
        maxheap = []
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            if len(maxheap) == k and -maxheap[0] < nums[i] and Kbig_left[i]:
                result += 1
            heappush(maxheap, -nums[i])
            if len(maxheap) > k:
                heappop(maxheap)
        return result
```
