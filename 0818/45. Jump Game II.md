In each step, try to reach the farest as one can. (Greedy)

```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return 0
        cover = nums[0]
        jump = 1
        ptr = 1
        while cover < len(nums) - 1:
            nextcover = cover
            while ptr <= cover:
                nextcover = max(nextcover, nums[ptr] + ptr)
                ptr += 1
            jump += 1
            cover = nextcover
        return jump
```
