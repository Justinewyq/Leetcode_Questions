# 2513. Minimize the Maximum of Two Arrays

Binary search.

For a number X to be valid, it should:
1. The number of integers within X and NOT divisable by `divisor1` >= `uniqueCtn1`.
2. The number of integers within X and NOT divisable by `divisor2` >= `uniqueCtn2`.
3. The number of integers within X and NOT divisable by at least one of `divisor1` and `divisor2` >= `uniqueCtn1 + uniqueCtn2`.

* First compute the number of integers divisable by both `divisor1` and `divisor2` (The LCM).
```python
class Solution:
    def gcd(self, x, y):
        while y:
            x, y = y, x % y
        return x
    
    # find the least common multiple of x and y
    def LCM(self, x, y):
        return x * y // self.gcd(x, y)

    def minimizeSet(self, divisor1: int, divisor2: int, uniqueCnt1: int, uniqueCnt2: int) -> int:
        left = uniqueCnt1 + uniqueCnt2
        right = 2 * left

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            print(mid)
            # 1. the # of integers < mid and not divisable by divisor1 should >= cnt1
            if mid - mid // divisor1 < uniqueCnt1:
                left = mid + 1
                continue
            # 2. the # of integers < mid and not divisable by divisor2 should >= cnt2
            if mid - mid // divisor2 < uniqueCnt2:
                left = mid + 1
                continue
            # 3. the # of integers not divisable by at least div1 or div2 >= cnt1 + cnt2
            div_by_both = mid // self.LCM(divisor1, divisor2)
            if mid - div_by_both < uniqueCnt1 + uniqueCnt2:
                left = mid + 1
                continue
            
            right = mid
        return left
```

* Time: O(log(uniqueCnt1 + uniqueCnt2))
* Space: O(1)
