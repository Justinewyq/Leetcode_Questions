# 200. Number of Islands

DFS search, in 4 directions.

Mark the `grid[x][y]` as visited(-1) once hit.

```python
class Solution:
    def search_and_mark(self, grid, x, y):
        grid[x][y] = '-1'
        dir = [[-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]]
        for d in dir:
            x_new = x + d[0]
            y_new = y + d[1]
            if 0 <= x_new < len(grid) and 0 <= y_new < len(grid[0]) and grid[x_new][y_new] == '1':
                self.search_and_mark(grid, x_new, y_new)

    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    self.search_and_mark(grid, i, j)
                    result += 1
        return result
```

* Time: O(n ^ 2) (Each point is visited at most once.)
* Space: O(1). Operations are done on the original space.
