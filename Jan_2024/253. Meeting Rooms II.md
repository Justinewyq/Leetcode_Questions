# 253. Meeting Rooms II

* Use a minheap to save the earliest available time of each meeting room.

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Sort the array increasingly according to start time
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x : x[0])

        roomHeap = [] # the min heap saves the earliest free time of each meeting room
        
        heapq.heappush(roomHeap, intervals[0][1])

        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            minEnd = roomHeap[0]
            if intervals[i][0] >= minEnd:
                heapq.heappop(roomHeap)
                heapq.heappush(roomHeap, intervals[i][1])
            else:
                heapq.heappush(roomHeap, intervals[i][1])
        
        return len(roomHeap)
```

* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n), worst case.
