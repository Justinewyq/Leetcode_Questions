# 387. First Unique Character in a String

`clist` to save the status of each letter:
* -2: the letter has not occured
* 0+: the first occurence of the letter
* -1: the letter has occured more than once

```python
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        clist = [-2] * 26
        for i in range(len(s)):
            ind = ord(s[i]) - ord('a')
            if clist[ind] == -2:
                clist[ind] = i
            else: # the letter has occured >= 1 time
                clist[ind] = -1
        result = len(s)
        for pos in clist:
            if pos >= 0:
                result = min(result, pos)
        
        if result == len(s):
            return -1
        else:
            return result
```
