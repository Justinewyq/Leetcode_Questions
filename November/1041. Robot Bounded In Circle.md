# 1041. Robot Bounded In Circle

## Solution:

After at most 4 cycles, the robot would return to (0, 0) if there exists a cycle.

We do not need to run 4 cycles to identify the limit cycle trajectory. One cycle is enough. There could be two situations here:

* if the robot returns to the initial point after one cycle, that's the limit cycle trajectory.

* if the robot doesn't face north at the end of the first cycle, that's the limit cycle trajectory.

class Solution:
    def isRobotBounded(self, instructions: str) -> bool:
        dir = 0
        dir_pos = [0, 1]
        x, y = 0, 0
        #for i in range(4):
        for instr in instructions:
            if instr == 'G':
                x += dir_pos[0]
                y += dir_pos[1]
            elif instr == 'L':
                if dir == 0: # north
                    dir = 1
                    dir_pos = [-1, 0]
                elif dir == 1: # west
                    dir = 2
                    dir_pos = [0, -1]
                elif dir == 2: # south
                    dir = 3
                    dir_pos = [1, 0]
                else: # east
