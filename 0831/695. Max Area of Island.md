* Use `set` to record if a island area is visited.

* Use recursion to recursively compute the area of the island, in 4-direction.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        seen = set()
        result = 0

        def findArea(x, y):
            if grid[x][y] == 0 or (x, y) in seen:
                return 0
            #print(x, y)
            add = 1
            seen.add((x, y))
            a = [-1, 1]
            for i in range(len(a)):
                x_neighbor = x
                y_neighbor = y + a[i]
                if 0 <= x_neighbor < len(grid) and 0 <= y_neighbor < len(grid[0]):
                    add += findArea(x_neighbor, y_neighbor)

                y_neighbor = y
                if 0 <= x_neighbor < len(grid) and 0 <= y_neighbor < len(grid[0]):
                    add += findArea(x_neighbor, y_neighbor)
