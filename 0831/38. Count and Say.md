# 38. Count and Say

The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

`countAndSay(1)` = "1"

`countAndSay(n)` is the way you would "say" the digit string from `countAndSay(n-1)`, which is then converted into a different digit string.

* Solve using recursion.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countAndSay(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        if n == 1:
            return "1"
        s = self.countAndSay(n - 1)

        result = ""
        cnt = 1
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            return "1" + s

        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if s[i] == s[i + 1]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                result += str(cnt) + s[i]
                cnt = 1
        result += str(cnt) + s[-1]
        print(n, result)
        return result
```
