2 pointers questions.

In each iteration, move the pointer with smaller height value. (We want to trap as much water as we can.)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        result = 0
        while left < right:
            water = (right - left) * min(height[left], height[right])
            result = max(result, water)
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        return result
```
